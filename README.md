# 1-Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits-with-scikit-learn
# Aim: 
To perform Data Analysis to accept or reject this Hypothesis.

# Hypothesis: 
The Digits data set of the Scikit-learn library provides numerous data-sets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times.

# Methods:
    (i) Libraries: Sklearn and Matplotlib.
    
    (ii) Dataset: Handwritten Digits dataset which is already ready in the sklearn library.

    (iii) Models Used to Test Accuracy:   1.Support Vector Classifier
                                          2.Decision Tree Classifier
                                          3.Random Forest Classifier

# Conclusion:
As per the hypothesis, we can say with hyperparameter tuning with different machine learning models or using more data we can achieve near 95% accuracy on the handwritten dataset. But make sure we also have a good amount of test data otherwise the model will get overfit.
